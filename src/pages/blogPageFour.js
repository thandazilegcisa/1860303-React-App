                    In the article of the above title Vee (2013) presents a very interesting perspective about how computer programming should be re-examined in accordance with the values, morals or other discourses we may have with regard to programming. He argues that programming and writing have displayed similar historical trajectories as mediums and tools for describing a message. And by re-examining how society thinks about programming “computational literacy could help us to better understand the social, technical and cultural dynamics of programming” (Vee 2013). Hence, since the 1970s computer enthusiasts have employed the concept of “literacy” to highlight the importance, flexibility, and power of writing for and with computers (Vee 2013).

                    Literacy from my perspective, is centered around building/constructing a specific conceptual framework in which symbolic signifiers such as text, visual art, sound, and code can be represented. Therefore, literacy comes with understanding how to decode the signified in order to interpret the representational value or sematic meaning. Thus, people and societies need literacies to negotiate their world. Hence, from this we can infer that like textual literacy, computer programming is a human facility with a symbolic technology – code – that allow myself as the programmer to represent and interpret the scope of this website.

                    Coding has now become a part of the infrastructure that governs how we text, call, and make tick toks for, and with each other. Because it makes up how we build an economy, or network of communities with these apps. However, due to the great digital divide the ability to read and write code is not yet widespread as compared to the use of these applications. This means that most people are consumers of the material affordances (or intelligence). More recently research into this realm of study includes debate around terms to describe the form of literacy that programming might represent including “procedural literacy”, “computational literacy”, and “computational thinking” (Vee 2013). Influenced by the concepts that these terms present Vee (2013) defines computational literacy as “the constellation of abilities to break a complex process down into small procedures and then express or “write” those procedures using the technology of code that may be read by a non-human entity such as a computer.

                    Over the past years designers of programming languages have made more writer-friendly languages or add-ons that provide meaning to the semantics of how code is structured or written for example, currently I have an extension installed in my development software (vs code) that colours semantics like brackets, curly braces so that I am able to easily identify any block of indention. If we look at WIX, at its core WIX is a product that provides an easy and accessible way to creating Websites. However, from a computational literacy perspective WIX is just that – a product – It is innately built for consumption rather than production of software. This means that WIX control or are the only party that has knowledge of the computational specifics of the site. Whereas the WIX user does not. This does not promote computational literacy instead it negates it.

                    Therefore, creating a site in the vain that which I created this current site speaks to computational literacy because due to the accessibility of development environments that allow me to use Javascript, Html, Css and hosting sites like github I am able to create this piece of software. Therefore, code has become central to how we construct or see ourselves within the broader digital vernacular of the internet. Hence, the need to use software has become prevalent in almost all job description lists (Vee 2013). In fact Vee (2013) argues that “it is important that end users know how to program so that the many decisions a democratic society faces about the use of computers, including difficult issues of privacy, freedom of speech, and civil liberties are negotiated from a more knowledgeable standpoint”.

                    <p className="three-P">
                    One thing that I got in my feedback that also speaks to this concept is that because programming languages are written by people, programmers write code not only for computers but also for other programmers. Which is why I comment my code – for readability – not only from my side but potential team members to be able to interpret and decode what I have coded.
                    Therefore, just as writing gained literacy amongst the masses and worked its way into the organisation of government and social infrastructures, programming reinforces many of the practices previously dominated by writing. Thus, according to (Vee 2013) looking at the writing of code through the concept of computational literacy allows us to critically engage with software as a discursive framework, which thereby allows us to think about ways in which we can decentralise the distribution of power to make and build applications.
