                    For my project i would like to examine the lense of culture and what
            decolonisation means for me in this context. The art work will
            predominately be based on presenting the website itself as an
            artwork through its design. Therefore, to achieve this i plan on
            using Svg's along with Css and React to create the design
                    </p>
                    <img
            class="moodboard"
            src="../Images/Moodboard.png"
            alt="A Collage of Images"
          />
                    <p className="three-P">
                    Above is a moodboard indicating where i gain my inspiration to
            inform what i will be looking to create. The Image and such prints 
            are usually practiced mostly through the medium of fashion, although
            the some practitioners also use the sculpting of cermaics to
            practice the art. I would like to create these prints to design how
            the footer, navigation, buttons and some parts of the body. I would
            also like to incorporate animation, animate the prints when users
            interact (mainly click and hover animations) with links and buttons
                    </p>
                    <p className="three-P">
                    I was very overwhelmed with other course work so a prototype is not
            something that i have right now, because although i knew very early
            on that i want to use svg's but did not specifically have an idea of
            what i wanted to achieve. Hence, i do not have a lot to offer with
            regard to the planning of my site. However, i have now established
            that this is a project that i would like to purse more intently by
            the next submission. Therefore, i would like to have implemented the
            art by the next submission, though without the animations. Although
            I would like to complete the animations after our next submission.
