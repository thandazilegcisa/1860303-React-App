                    <p className="one-P">
            Well for starters, throughout their article Catherine Walsh and Walter Mignolo
            do not introduce themselves as the arbiter, saviours that will emancipate
            the reader from the compound expression they refer to as "The colonial matrix of power".
            Instead they point out that if they were to do so they would be reinforcing 
            colonial sentiments by positioning themselves as the "master" or "beholder knowledge".
            Which is why their paper examines decoloniality from a perspective of relationality.
            According to Mignolo et al (2018).Relationality encompasses the ways that different local histories embody the 
            concepts and practices of decoloniality across geopolitical locations and pan-african
            colonial differences. The idea of Relationality, can also be understood from a semiotic
            point of view where Stuart Hall upholds the signifier, or signified as the culmination 
            of constructed meanings that come from a particular context. Therefore what relationality 
            does is that it represents and creates "pluriversal and interversal paths that disturb the
            totality from which the universal and the global are most often perceived" (Mignolo, 2018)
          </p>
          <p className="one-P">
            Furthermore, the plurality thats presented through the praxis,
            seeks to bring together the collective pan-african discussion of what 
            decolonisation means to them. By so doing it prioritises geo-political relative truths,
            instead of an absolute truth about what decolonisation means to the
            formerly colonised. This is important because this signifies the
            ideals of decoloniality, which is to not only consider absolute
            truths presented by western civilisations as valid but instead
            consider other ways and forms of cultivating knowledge, narratives 
            and subjectivities without necessary blindly accepting western thought 
            as the absolute truth.
          </p>
          <p className="one-P">
            This is where the idea of modernity comes in, this considers that
            western thought and civilisation through the lens of modernity is in
            most of us. This is because modernity was built on coloniality, which
            has consequently negated, distorted, and denied difference. 
            Therefore, because decoloniality is a standpoint or practice.
            I would like to discuss and explore decolonisation through the 
            lens of  heritage in an effort to represent and render myself visible 
            through this website. During the 20 century colonisation, separation,
            segregation acts (apartheid) defined the mobility of the formerly colonised. And
            subsequently since the dawn of the industrial revolution the
            migration to urban centers and towns/townships away form traditional
            homesteads has brought about elements of coloniality and modernity  into the South
            African lives. And considering that modernity is a way of living it
            means that it is a practice and custom, which therefore challenges and sometimes 
            denies natives the plurality of practicing these customs.
          </p>
          <p className="one-P">
            To put this convergence into perspective i will use the following
            example. In Xhosa tradition boys ordained into manhood by performing
            traditional method of circumcision that is a part of a whole
            ceremony that is not just exclusive to circumcision but other
            beliefs and customs, although this project will not necessary
            discuss these practices. I only seek to highlight how the modernity
            of daily life and use of modern medicine (Anesthetics) results/
            could potentially result in being othered by the people of the
            culture despite sharing the same heritage and language,thus because
            of this element of modernity and coloniality, in the face of culture
            one would not be seen as a true Xhosa man.
          </p>
          <p className="one-P">
            So in light of this i though it would be interesting to interrogate
            the act of "seeing myself clearly" or "re-existence" in relation to otherselves with
            whom we share the universe and particularly culture for this
            project. Because with the example in consideration i am in a
            position where i am modernised and colonised by the practices that
            i've taken and not taken in the view of culture. And consequently i
            cannot necessary eliminate my modernity. Therefore, decolonisation
            becomes a very important concept/practice to consider or relate, and as such
            since this perspective is about culture and heritage, I will
            interrogate decolonisation from the perspective of participating in
            practicing art as heritage through and on the internet. By choosing to 
            use the medium of the web i also welcome modernity and using "the masters
            tool", however how i've chosen to contextualise and rationalise my site 
            in a way that presents and represent my own decolonial liberation, signified by 
            my heritage.
