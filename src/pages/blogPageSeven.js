                    I combined these reflections they exist as one as a result of what i
            seek to achieve with the project. Seeing that i will be using svg's
            and css animations to achieve this and that this artwork will
            predominately be based on the idea of creative coding. This idea
            commonly involves the use of software, code to create art. And
            though creative coding is commonly thought of from the lense of
            aesthetics i want to tie in my project with the core functionalities
            of the website including buttons,and links.

                    <p className="three-P">
                    Considering that i have used svg's in learning, and exploring data
            visualisations. I think its a skill that i already have and
            practiced so that made deciding to do this project much easier. All
            i have to actually learn to do is react form now till the next
            submission therefore, that is one technical challenge that i forsee.
            Besides that what i've achieved so far is deciding on what
            theoretical framework i want to situate my project in and that has
            made it easier in establishing the goals that i want to achieve with
            the project (as detailed in the proposal).

                    For now the site functions as a canvas. That uses Css properties
            such as Flex Box - for the navigation and Grid Layout for the layout
            of the blogs section. The current site responds to different form
            factors and will still be something that i intently consider when
            adding more elements to the site. And considering the fact i will be
            using React.js and rebuilding the site adding animations,
            interactivity was not a priority.
